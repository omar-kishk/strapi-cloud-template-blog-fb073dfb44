# Claude Workflows

## Feature Delivery
- Read: requirements, architecture, site-map
- Design: propose component API with types, a11y plan
- Implement: server-first, Tailwind, tests
- Verify: AR/EN layouts, a11y, performance budgets
- Document: update relevant docs and diagrams

## Diagram Updates (Eraser)
- Edit files in `../docs/diagrams/` and commit with PR

## Checklists
- A11y: keyboard, focus-visible, roles, labels, reduced motion
- Perf: avoid layout thrash; use transforms; code-split as needed
- Security: RBAC on server; input validation; secrets safety
